## 🚀 Overview

**FYNANCE** is a personal finance application designed to feel like a spatial operating system. It moves beyond simple spreadsheets by integrating **Behavioral Analytics** and **AI Interventions**.

At its core is **Fin**, an AI agent powered by Google Gemini (via LangChain) that doesn't just answer questions—it analyzes your spending patterns, detects impulsive behavior, and intervenes with "micro-lessons" to help you build wealth.

## ✨ Key Features

- **💎 VisionOS UI**: A stunning, depth-based interface with glassmorphism, floating navigational elements, and ambient lighting.
- **🤖 AI Financial Coach ("Fin")**:
  - **Chat**: A fully contextual chatbot that knows your financial history and goals.
  - **Intervention Engine**: Detects high-risk spending (e.g., late-night shopping) and nudges you before you buy.
  - **Simulation**: Projects your financial future 6 months out based on current habits vs. optimized habits.
- **📊 Core Financials**:
  - **Spending Tracker**: Log transactions with categories and dates.
  - **Subscription Manager**: Track recurring costs and see the total monthly drain.
  - **Goal Setting**: Set visual savings targets.
- **🧠 Mood & Behavior**:
  - **Mood Logger**: Track how you feel when you spend to identify emotional spending triggers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3 (Variables, Grid, Glassmorphism). No frameworks, just pure performance.
- **Backend**: Python **FastAPI** (High performance, async).
- **AI Engine**: 
  - **LangChain**: For agentic workflows and chain management.
  - **Google Gemini Pro**: For reasoning and generation.
  - **ChromaDB** (Planned): For RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
- **Database**: SQLite (Simple, file-based persistence).
